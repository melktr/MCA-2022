Question 5

Consider the plots above.

Do all songs have the same duration?

Are there any noticeable patterns, e.g.

certain notes being more prevalent that others?

stark changes along the x-axis indicating change from verse to chorus?

Can you - by looking at the plots - say which tracks are similar and which are dissimilar?

Question 10

We can think of these averages as the note profile for each track; i.e. how often is a given note played throughout the song.

Is it easier to describe the difference between tracks with this representation compared to e.g. a spectrogram?

Question 12

The plot shows the 10 songs in a 2D space

Can you think of a way to measure distance between two songs in this space?

Questions 16

If I want something similar to track_10 which track would you recommend based on the computed similarity?

Can you identify some structure in the distance matrix which reflects the nature of the tracks we are considering?

Questions18 

Are the distances the same as above?

Is the stucture more clear?

Which matrix would you trust to best describe the similarities?
