## __WEEK 2__

For week 2, I opted to transcribe the first few bars of Xenakis' "XAƧ" (SAX spelt backwards), which was originally created for the Rascher Saxophone Quartet. Unfortunately, the original score was ineligible for Musescore's PDF converter, thus here is my attempt at generating a clear version of it. 

The images below are from a pdf version of my MuseScore file.
