## __WEEK 4__

For this week's lab we had to export our musescore file to MIDI and run it through jSymbolic.jar then after adjusting the relevant settings, import our CSV file in Excel.

This allowed me to look through the data of the piece and create a graph of the percentages of the significant numbers on pitches and their data. 

You can download the MIDI file [here](https://github.com/melktr/MCA-2022/blob/master/Labs/WEEK%204/XA%C6%A7%20musescore.mid)
