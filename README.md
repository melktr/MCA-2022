## __WEEK 1__

&#10238; ## THEME

My dataset is based on ***Iannis Xenakis (Greek: Γιάννης "Ιωάννης" Κλέαρχου Ξενάκης)*** , a Romanian-born Greek-French avant-garde composer, music theorist, architect, performance director, and engineer. He revolutionized the application of mathematical models in music, including  stochastic processes, applications of set theory and game theory, and had substantial impact on the growth of electronic and computer music. He fused music and architecture by writing music for specific locations and designing surroundings that could be linked to certain music compositions and performances.

Some of his greatest works include *"Metastaseis" (1953-54)* for orchestra, with independent parts for each musician in the orchestra; percussion works such as *"Psappha" (1975)* and *"Pléades" (1979)*, *"Terretektor " (1966)*, which introduced  multidimensional sound by dispersing musicians among the audience, electronic works created using Xenakis's UPIC system (computerised musical composition tool); and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis dubbed  *"Polytopes"* fusing the ancient greek terms “poly” (“many”) and “topos” (“place”).
