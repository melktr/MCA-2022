* QUESTION 1

What do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)?

&#8688; To identify digital music content, two significant standards were established in music data management: ISRC for sound recordings and ISWC for underlying works. These were developed to promote standardisation and interoperability, but there are significant issues in linking ISRC and ISWC identifier systems, including: 

• a lack of understanding of the proper use of ISRC, which is frequently compounded by inconsistent application of this standard's guidelines, frequently leading to misuse and duplication; 

• the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of music publishing data, which is less readily available at the point of first release. Several parties that have found it difficult to reconcile ISRC and ISWC have developed their own internal connecting solutions, which have required significant financial expenditure and manual processing.

&#8688; Two other significant issues are with recommender systems called the "Cold start problem" and "the Sparsity problem." 
When a new user registers with the system or a new item is uploaded to the catalogue and the system lacks appropriate data for these items/users. In this instance, the system will be unable to appropriately promote existing goods to a new user (new user problem).

The Sparsity problem occurs when the number of given ratings is significantly less than the number of possible ratings, which is especially frequent when the number of users and objects is big. Sparsity is defined as the inverse of the ratio of given to potential ratings. Because most users rate just a small percentage, high sparsity corresponds to low rating coverage. As a result, suggestions are frequently rendered untrustworthy.

&#8688; Concluding, music is frequently listened to unconsciously, in the background. Although not a problem in and of itself, this may have an impact on preference elicitation. The fact that a listener is not paying attention to the music (thus, for example, not skipping a song) could be mistakenly regarded as a good signal, especially when employing implicit feedback to infer listener preferences.
