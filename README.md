## __WEEK 1__

### &#10238;THEME

My dataset is based on ***Iannis Xenakis (Greek: Γιάννης "Ιωάννης" Κλέαρχου Ξενάκης)*** , a Romanian-born Greek-French avant-garde composer, music theorist, architect, performance director, and engineer. He revolutionized the application of mathematical models in music, including  stochastic processes, applications of set theory and game theory, and had substantial impact on the growth of electronic and computer music. He fused music and architecture by writing music for specific locations and designing surroundings that could be linked to certain music compositions and performances.

Some of his greatest works include *"Metastaseis" (1953-54)* for orchestra, with independent parts for each musician in the orchestra; percussion works such as *"Psappha" (1975)* and *"Pléades" (1979)*, *"Terretektor " (1966)*, which introduced  multidimensional sound by dispersing musicians among the audience, electronic works created using Xenakis's UPIC system (computerised musical composition tool); and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis dubbed  *"Polytopes"* fusing the ancient greek terms “poly” (“many”) and “topos” (“place”).

### &#10238; Obstacles in interacting with music and music-related data

&#8688; *Access*

Accessing music data has become incredibly simple in recent years, but primarily for well-known, or 'popular,' singers and artists. Iannis Xenakis has built a name for himself as a composer, yet his data is not as extensive as that of a pop singer. Many of his works, such as music, architecture, and photography, are included on the composer's website, as well as his bibliography and biography, old and new performances or exhibits in his honour, archives, and many more. This information, however, is not visible on major sites that distribute his music, such as Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music.

Albums, popular releases, singles or EPs, compilations, features, featured playlists, songs' names, artist name, album names, duration of songs, composers, genre, year, track number, track time, play count, user ratings, album/single artwork, lyricists, copyright information, and merch are all visible data on Spotify. 

These may appear to be a lot at first glance, but there are some restrictions. The volume of data available on individual categories makes it harder to analyse, and thus contributes to the data being misconstrued. In this situation, the data is reliant on a "computer," which limits the material to what the device, or the device's operator, decides to display.

&#8688; *Curation*



&#8688; *Distribution*

* QUESTION 2

How does your selected theme display some of these challenges?

* QUESTION 3

Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how:

&#10149; 3A

It is presently curated (collected and gathered)?

&#10149; 3B

How it is presented, described, and analysed?
