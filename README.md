## __WEEK 1__

### &#10238;THEME

My dataset is based on ***Iannis Xenakis (Greek: Γιάννης "Ιωάννης" Κλέαρχου Ξενάκης)*** , a Romanian-born Greek-French avant-garde composer, music theorist, architect, performance director, and engineer. He revolutionized the application of mathematical models in music, including  stochastic processes, applications of set theory and game theory, and had substantial impact on the growth of electronic and computer music. He fused music and architecture by writing music for specific locations and designing surroundings that could be linked to certain music compositions and performances.

Some of his greatest works include *"Metastaseis" (1953-54)* for orchestra, with independent parts for each musician in the orchestra; percussion works such as *"Psappha" (1975)* and *"Pléades" (1979)*, *"Terretektor " (1966)*, which introduced  multidimensional sound by dispersing musicians among the audience, electronic works created using Xenakis's UPIC system (computerised musical composition tool); and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis dubbed  *"Polytopes"* fusing the ancient greek terms “poly” (“many”) and “topos” (“place”).

### &#10238; Obstacles in interacting with music and music-related data and their display on Iannis Xenakis through Spotify 

###### &#8688; *Access*

Accessing music data has become incredibly simple in recent years, but primarily for well-known, or 'popular,' singers and artists. Iannis Xenakis has built a name for himself as a composer, yet his data is not as extensive as that of a pop singer. Many of his works, such as music, architecture, and photography, are included on the composer's website, as well as his bibliography and biography, old and new performances or exhibits in his honour, archives, and many more. This information, however, is not visible on major sites that distribute his music, such as Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music.

Albums, popular releases, singles or EPs, compilations, features, featured playlists, songs' names, artist name, album names, duration of songs, composers, genre, year, track number, track time, play count, user ratings, album/single artwork, lyricists, copyright information, and merch are all visible data on Spotify. 

These may appear to be a lot at first glance, but there are some restrictions. The volume of data available on individual categories makes it harder to analyse, and thus contributes to the data being misconstrued. In this situation, the data is reliant on a "computer," which limits the material to what the device, or the device's operator, decides to display.

###### &#8688; *Curation*

Spotify has shifted to machine learning and other algorithmic-based methods. It has developed a service called "Discover Weekly" that customises a playlist of new music for each user every Monday based on their listening patterns. "Discover Weekly" employs three types of recommendation models: **collaborative filtering, natural language processing (NLP), and raw audio.**

The majority of Spotify's curation originates through c**ollaborative filtering**. That means Spotify map out your preferences depending on your listening patterns and then locates other listeners whose maps match the most with yours. Then, Spotify will suggest music which these other users have listened to but you haven't. The second component, **NLP**, analyses the lyrics in songs.Spotify now creates a map of the track rather than a map of the user. Then, similar to collaborative filtering, it will compare the maps of several tracks to find the greatest overlap. The final input is a **raw audio model**. While the first two models are concerned with connecting users with popular songs, raw audio models help assess new music with less data. Spotify analyses fragmented  songs and categorises songsthem based on time signature, key, mode, tempo, and loudness by using convolutional neural networks. 

Spotify lacks curation in the case of Iannis Xenakis. His music is diversified and niche than commercial or mainstream. His intentions lean towards creating musical experiences and compositions performed in specific architectural settings. It is music designed for people to enjoy, which explains why Spotify, his profile isn't as established, and why they curated him only in one of their playlists.

###### &#8688; *Distribution*

In a world when music is publicly available, the most challenging difficulty that music distributors confront today is differentiating themselves by offering the finest music listening experience possible. Finding the appropriate music for each listener is critical to the whole experience. Unfortunately, the burden of quantity falls heavily on the shoulders of the artists. Some streaming services are fantastic at getting independent artists discovered, but the modest sum they pay must be divided between the distributor, record label (if any), and the artist.

This distinguishes Iannis Xenakis. Although his musical work is difficult to distribute as it is mostly experience-based and you can't transfer the emotional aspect, the humanised limited edition performance, and the feeling of the live soundwaves in your ears,  as previously noted, his work is available in a variety of formats. His music is available via streaming services, architectures, structures, exhibits, photography, notation (graphic and notated scores), audio arts, and different organisations continuing on his legacy, including The Philharmonic Orchestra of Paris, Trio Xenakis, the Hellenic Cultural Center, and Ina GRM.
